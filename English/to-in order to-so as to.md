# to… / in order to… / so as to…

The difference between `to` + infinitive & `in order to` + infinitive

Infinitive
* basic form of a verb
* Examples: give, prevent, agree


## When `to` & `in order to` are used the same

Using `in order to` sounds a bit more formal & explicit than `to` by itself. But, both are fine & common in written & spoken English.

Following two sentences have the same meaning:
* `To` cut the tree down, I had to buy a chainsaw
* `In order to` cut the tree down, I had to buy a chainsaw

Following two sentences have the same meaning:
* I went to the mall `to` buy clothes.
* I went to the mall `in order to` buy clothes.


## Difference - Negative infinitive

`In order to` is normal before a negative infinitive but `to` by itself is not usually used.

Example Sentences:
* `In order not to` oversleep, I set the alarm for seven o'clock.
* I walked very slowly across the room with the drinks `in order not` to spill them.


## `so as to` & `in order to`

`so as to` and `in order to` can be used interchangeably with the same level of formality & explicitness.

Example Sentences:
* We moved house last year `so as to` be closer to our children and grandchildren.
* I paid the cleaning lady in advance `to` ease her financial problems and `so as not` to impact her work.

Before stative verbs like `know`, `seem`, `appear`, `understand`, `have`, etc, it is more usual to use `in order to` or `so as to`:
* I talked to them both for half an hour `so as to` have a thorough understanding of the problem.
* I followed her around all day `in order to` know whether she had any intention of meeting him.


## So that… & in order that…

These structures are also frequently used to talk about purpose, although `so that` is more common and less formal than `in order that`.  
Note that these structures are normally used with (modal) auxiliary verbs.

Compare the following:
* She is staying in California for two more months `so that` she can perfect her English.
* She is staying in California for two more months `in order to` perfect her English.

* We are leaving by 2:00 pm `so that` we don't get stuck in the rush-hour traffic.
* We are leaving by 2:00 pm `so as not to` get stuck in the rush-hour traffic.

* William had an afternoon nap `so that` he wouldn't fall asleep at the concert later.
* William had an afternoon nap `in order not to` fall asleep at the concert later.

* Formal: `In order` *that you may* pass the exam, I recommend you read through all your notes.
* Causal: `In order to` pass the exam, I recommend you read through all your notes.

In causal English, `that` may be omitted from the `so that` construction.  
Listen out for this variation, though I wouldn't recommend that you use it:
* I'll come early `so` we can have a good chat before Denise arrives.
* I've bought a video camera `so` I can film the children as they grow up.
* We shall wear warm clothes when we go camping in October `so` we don't get cold.
